# Contributing Guidelines

Please make sure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

-  Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be duplicated.
-  Make an individual pull request for each suggestion for easier review.
-  Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
-  Pull request title should include the suggestion name and category.
   -  For example: 'add netlify to hosting'
-  Provide a link to the submitted suggestion in the pull request comment section.
   -  For example: 'netlify: https://netlify.com'
-  Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
   -  The description should start with a capital.
   -  The description should not be a title case.
   -  The description should not repeat the item title.
   -  The description should not be a marketing tagline.
-  Make sure your editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
-  Double-check if the suggestion is truly free, freemium, or has free tiers.
