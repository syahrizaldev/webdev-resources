## Contributing Guidelines

Please make sure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

-  Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be duplicated.
-  Make an individual pull request for each suggestion for easier review.
-  Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
-  The suggestion should be in English.
-  If the submitted project is an open-source project on GitHub:
   -  It should have at least 20 stars.
   -  The link is to the GitHub repo, not its website.
-  Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
   -  The description should not be a title case.
   -  The description should not repeat the item title.
   -  The description should not be a marketing tagline.
   -  The description should start with a capital and end with a full period.
-  Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
-  New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome but should be done in a separate pull request.
